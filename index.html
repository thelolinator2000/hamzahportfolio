								<p>This is my intro and I am going to show you what I have done in software engineering throughout my life. I have made games, and started a YouTube channel which I have managed to gather 111 subscribers. I am studying in The Radclyffe School and have 2 more years left before I graduate.</p>

                                        <p>This was my first big project in game development, and my first official one. I was part of a team of 3 people challenged to create a racing game. Me and my friend did the main programming of the game such as the movement mechanics and the main menus and scene loading. My other friend did the textures for the models.</p>

                                        <p>This was my second project in game development and my second official game. It was made by me on my own as a challenge to make a game in a few days. I made it and released it in 2019 and I made a lot of the mechanics and borrowed some of the mechanics built into Unity. I enjoyed making this game and it is probably my favourite out of the bunch.</p>

It isn't my best project, and definitely required the least effort, but nonetheless it was fun making it.</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>I am a student studying at The Radclyffe School. I left my primary school in 2018, which was Freehold Community Primary Academy - previously Freehold Community School. I am currently working on no projects other than this portfolio, but am thinking of making a stock Android Operating System Port for the Sony Experia L1 (G3311). I have had experience working with a couple of roms in the past and flashing kernels, but have never made one myself. I currently run a YouTube channel but have been inactive for several months, it is focused primarily on gaming, however I edit the videos and can learn whilst doing so.</p>
